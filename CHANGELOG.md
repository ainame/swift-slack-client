## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-28

### üêõ Fixed
- **Item.ts Property**: Added optional `ts` property to `Item` model for reaction event compatibility
  - Fixed DeepL translator demo app where `item.ts` was accessed but didn't exist
  - `Item` now has `public var ts: Swift.String?` to support both reaction events and other APIs
  - Maintains type safety by keeping `ts` optional since it's not present in all contexts

### ‚ú® Added  
- **Form-Encoding Middleware**: Automatic JSON to form-urlencoded conversion for Slack API compatibility
  - `FormEncodingMiddleware` installed by default in `SlackClient`
  - Transparent handling of Slack's POST + `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requirement
  - Nested objects automatically serialized as JSON strings in form data
- **swift-dotenv Integration**: Environment variable management for DeepL translator demo
  - Added swift-dotenv dependency for cleaner configuration management
  - Removed ProcessInfo fallbacks in favor of explicit environment variable loading

### üîß Enhanced
- **Code Generation Pipeline**: Improved schema generation with `ItemTsOptionalAdder` visitor
  - Automatically adds optional `ts` property to Item schema during generation
  - Ensures consistency across WebAPI and Events API usage
- **Documentation**: Updated README with form-encoding workaround explanation
  - Honest documentation of temporary workaround nature
  - Technical notes section explaining design decisions

### üìã Technical Notes
- Form-encoding middleware addresses swift-openapi-generator limitation with nested form data
- This is a workaround solution that may be updated in future versions
- All tests passing with new middleware and model changes

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-28

### üêõ Fixed
- **Slack API Compatibility**: Resolved `conversations.replies` "invalid_arguments" errors
  - Root cause: Slack APIs expect POST + `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, not `application/json`
  - swift-openapi-generator doesn't support nested containers with form-urlencoded
- **Modal View Protocol**: Fixed `callbackId` optionality mismatch between protocol and implementation
- **Test Suite**: Disabled WebSocket-dependent test that required mocking infrastructure

### ‚ú® Added
- **FormEncodingMiddleware**: Automatic request transformation for Slack API compatibility
  - Converts POST + JSON requests to POST + form-urlencoded automatically
  - Handles nested objects by serializing them as JSON strings in form fields
  - Installed by default in SlackClient for transparent operation

### üîß Enhanced  
- **DeepL Translator Demo**: Improved error handling and API compatibility
  - Fixed reaction event handling with proper `conversations.replies` usage
  - Enhanced duplicate translation detection logic
  - Better fallback handling for non-threaded messages

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-23

### üö® Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING**: Socket Mode interactive handlers now require explicit acknowledgment
  - Removed auto-acknowledgment for interactive handlers (global shortcuts, view submissions, slash commands, block actions, message shortcuts)
  - All interactive handlers must now call `try await context.ack()` 
  - Event API handlers remain unchanged (no acknowledgment required)
  - **Migration**: Add `try await context.ack()` at the start of your interactive handlers

### ‚ú® Added
- **Custom Ack Functionality**: New `Ack` struct with multiple acknowledgment methods
  - `ack()` - Basic acknowledgment
  - `ack(responseAction: .update, view:)` - Update views to keep modals open during processing
  - `ack(errors: [String: String])` - Send validation errors back to forms
  - Support for response actions: `.update`, `.push`, `.clear`
- **StateValuesObject**: New form value extraction system for SlackBlockKit
  - Subscript access: `payload.view.state?["blockId", "actionId"]?.value`
  - Support for `selectedOption`, `selectedOptions`, `selectedDate`, etc.
  - Computed `state` property on `View` enum for easy access
  - Comprehensive unit tests for JSON decoding scenarios
- **DeepL Translator Demo App**: Complete real-world Slack bot implementation
  - Global shortcut and reaction-based translation features
  - Modal UI with form handling and loading states  
  - Demonstrates proper custom Ack usage patterns
  - DeepL API integration with shared HTTPClient

### üêõ Fixed
- Added missing `ts` field to `Item` struct for reaction events
- Fixed reaction event handling for proper `conversations.replies` API usage

### üìö Documentation
- **Enhanced README**: Comprehensive Socket Mode acknowledgment documentation
- Added practical examples for form validation, loading states, and error handling
- Updated all Socket Mode code examples to demonstrate proper `ack()` usage
- Concrete type examples instead of generic placeholders

### üîß Changed
- Updated all examples to use explicit acknowledgment patterns
- Enhanced `SlackModalView` to require non-optional `callbackId`
- Improved error handling patterns throughout Socket Mode handlers

## [0.0.5] - 2025-01-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `SocketModeMessageRouter` to `SocketModeRouter` for brevity and consistency
  - Class renamed from `SocketModeMessageRouter` to `SocketModeRouter`
  - Method renamed from `addSocketModeMessageRouter(_:)` to `addSocketModeRouter(_:)`
  - All related type references updated accordingly
- Updated Slack API schemas to latest version
- Improved schema update workflow to only detect changes in Generated directories

### Documentation
- Added BlockKit examples section to README
- Fixed various README formatting issues

## [0.0.4] - 2025-06-01

### Added
- **MarkdownBlock Support**: Full implementation of MarkdownBlock with DSL integration and result builder patterns
- **Enhanced RichText API**: Complete coverage of all 9 Slack RichText element types (text, emoji, link, user, channel, date, broadcast, color, usergroup)
- **DSL Convenience Patterns**: Ergonomic initializers and patterns for common input elements and usage scenarios
- **Comprehensive Examples**: New snippet examples demonstrating MarkdownBlock, RichText features, and DSL convenience patterns
- **Shields.io Badges**: Professional badges in README for Swift version, SPM compatibility, license, releases, documentation, and build status

### Enhanced
- **SlackBlockKitDSL**: Added comprehensive convenience initializers for PlainTextInput, StaticSelect, ChannelsSelect, UsersSelect, and other common elements

### Added
- Comprehensive regression test suite for SocketModeMessageRouter
- Internal initializers for SocketModeMessageEnvelope and EventsApiEnvelope to support testing

### Fixed
- Event type casting issue in SocketModeMessageRouter.onEvent<T: SlackEvent> method
