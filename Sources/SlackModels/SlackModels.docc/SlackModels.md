# ``SlackModels``

Shared data models and types for the Slack API ecosystem.

## Overview

SlackModels provides a comprehensive collection of Swift types representing Slack's data models. These types are shared across all swift-slack-client modules, ensuring consistency and type safety when working with Slack API data.

All models are automatically generated from Slack's official API specifications, with additional handcrafted models for complex scenarios and enhanced usability.
